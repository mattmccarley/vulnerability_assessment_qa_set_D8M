- User Space: Contains user applications and libraries. It enhances security by isolating user processes from critical system functions.
- File System: Organizes and manages data storage. It supports security through file permissions and access controls.
- Device Drivers: Interface between hardware and software. They contribute to security by controlling access to hardware resources.
- System Libraries: Provide common functions for applications. They enhance security by offering standardized, secure implementations of common operations.
